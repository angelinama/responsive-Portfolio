# responsive-Portfolio
A responsive portfolio website containing three pages: about me, portfolio, contact page.
Here are three different views based on devise screen sizes:

</div>

#NOTE
Instruction in README for this homework mentioned: "On an xs screen, content should take up the entire screen. On sm AND larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen". But Bootstrap 4 breakpoint sm is 576px but md is 768px. So I believe that was a typo. Also, from the screenshots provided in Assets folder, it seems on 768px screen, content takes up the entire screen rather than same layout as larger screen.
My solution is based on the screenshots.
